# Wordle

This project was created because 1 wordle a day is simply not enough

---

### Phase 1: build basic wordle
> completed on 26th Jan 2025
  - Basic wordle functionality
  - Create a nice dataset of 5-letter words
  - TODO: UI (letters jump) when user gets the correct word


### Phase 2: deploy website
> WIP


### Phase 3: extend functionality to n-letter words 
> WIP

 

### Phase 4: implement user service
> WIP
  - TODO: log in and sign up system (only needed to unlock phase 5 features. The main wordle is F2P)


### Phase 5.1: implement user stats (e.g. similar to wordle's accuracy system)
> WIP


### Phase 5.2: implement 1v1 system (which user can guess the fastest? Users can see each other's progress live) (game modes are: n-letter words, maximum no. of guesses, how many rounds etc)
> WIP
